# alt-py-wallet

Working prototype for a desktop python altcoin desktop client (currently runs over Testnet).

This prototype was made for a project that unfortunately got cancelled shortly after it started. The current version
was implemented for demostration pruporses, things to be done for an actual usable version:

  * Solve scalability problems.
  * Use self services instead of relying on 3ยบ parties.
  * Test corner cases.
  * Improve its "looks".
